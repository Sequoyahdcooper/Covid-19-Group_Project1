Data Viz Class Group project 1
Covid-19 Analysis
Researched many sites for data exploration. Located reliable data (out of the many sources providing COVID 19 data right now).
Created CSV files for certain datasets because the data was not available for download in a proper format. Used the Pandas library
within Python to read in CSV files, and to connect to APIs. Cleaned the data. Created separate dataframes and merged into two
main dataframes to make working with the data easier. Used the MatPlotLib library with Python to create multiple graphs to
visualize trends and findings
